# Video_Content_Recommender_System
This recommender system is similar to the recommender system in any online video sharing platform like YOUTUBE.
First of all, it looks at the watching history of each user, where it shows how long he/she has watched a video and how many such videos he/she has watched.
Accordingly, it gives similar kinds of videos for every video for each user. Then it will sort the video based on similarity rate and gives the topmost similar videos.
This process will be followed for each user.
